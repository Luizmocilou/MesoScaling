# Understanding the scaling phenomena within cities

## Abstract

Understanding quantitative relationships between urban elements is crucial for applications such as infrastructure investment and urban planning. At the city level, urban scaling is considered to be an important framework that quantifies the power-law relationship between aggregated urban quantities (e.g., GDP) and population. However, at the microscopic level, there is lack of a systematic study to quantify and model relationships between urban elements within cities, where the distributions of population and socioeconomic activity are strikingly heterogeneous. Here, leveraging on large-scale mobile phone data and urban facility data, we show that infrastructure and socioeconomic activity have universal connections with the active population at the micro level, which can be well fitted by sub- and super-linear power-law relationships, respectively. However, we also find that the power-law exponents vary in cities of similar size, which is inconsistent with the current scaling framework. We propose a model that unifies the heterogeneous distributions of population and spatial interactions to explain all our empirical findings. By employing the active population as a gravity field, our model also shows an interesting connection between intra-urban scaling behaviors and human mobility.
