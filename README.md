# Quantifying spatial scaling within cities

Lei Dong, Zhou Huang, and Yu Liu

## Abstract

Despite the complexity and diversity of cities, it is found that most characteristics of a city scale with its population size in a surprisingly simple power-law manner. Yet, while these scaling phenomena have been widely acknowledged across cities, we lack an understanding of whether the power-law scaling holds within a city, a fundamental question regarding the spatial origin of urban scaling. Here, we discuss the intra-urban scaling by analyzing four extensive microdata covering hundreds of millions of mobile phone users and urban facilities. Within cities, we show robust sub- and super-linear scaling relations for infrastructure and socioeconomic activity, respectively. Remarkably, the values of these exponents are consistent with previous cross-city findings. Furthermore, we propose a modeling framework by considering the heterogeneous population distribution and the spatial interactions to explain these empirical observations. The revealed properties of the intra-urban scaling echo the fractal nature of cities and are of considerable policy relevance.
