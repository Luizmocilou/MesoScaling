# Quantifying urban population density and scaling beyond two-dimensional space

Lei Dong, Zhou Huang, and Yu Liu

## Abstract

Population density is one of the most important indicators for measuring urban properties, and is widely used in quantitative analysis of social and natural sciences. Most of the previous studies treated city as a two-dimensional plane, on the basis of which population density and a series of statistical indicators (e.g., scaling exponents) were discussed. However, an important distinction between city and rural area is the presence of tall buildings that expand city to the third dimension -- sky and underground. Here we analyze the spatial organization of cities by including the three-dimensional information -- building footprints and number of floors, and granular population distribution data estimated by mobile phone dataset. We differentiate population into daytime and nighttime distributions, and construct the `active' population distribution by weighting them together. Our results show that the active population density gradient is almost conserved after taking the total floor area as the denominator. This reflects the individual's need for space is stable -- does not change much with population concentration. Furthermore, we calculate within-city scaling exponents between active population, building footprint, and total floor area, and show the possibility of unifying three scaling exponents -- 2/3, 5/6, and 1 -- between urban area and population under the framework of classifying urban spaces into shareable and non-shareable categories.
