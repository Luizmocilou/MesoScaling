# Quantifying urban population density and scaling beyond the two-dimensional space

Lei Dong, Zhou Huang, and Yu Liu

## Abstract

The city is usually being treated as a two-dimensional plane, where population density, scaling exponents, and many other crucial indicators have been extensively studied. However, rapid urbanization and innovation in building technology present challenges to the two-dimension assumption as the emergence of tall buildings is expanding the city into the third (vertical) dimension -- the sky and underground. Meanwhile, the increasing population dynamics makes it `inaccurate' when measuring population density or scaling by `static' survey data. Here we analyze the three-dimensional spatial organization of cities by including building-level information and granular population distribution data. We also include the temporal dimension of population dynamics and construct an `active population' distribution by combining the daytime and nighttime distributions together. Our results show that the active population density gradient is remarkably stable after taking the vertical and temporal dimensions into account, which has not been documented before. This result reflects the idea that an individual's actual need for space does not change much with population concentration. Furthermore, we show for the first time a scaling exponent of 5/6 between total floor area and the active population size within cities. Finally, we demonstrate the possibility of unifying the three scaling exponents -- 2/3, 5/6, and 1 -- between the urban area and population under the framework of classifying urban spaces into shareable and nonshareable categories. The revealed properties of the vertical and temporal dimensions place an important extension on the theory of urban spatial structure, and could be applied to urban planning and sustainability studies.
