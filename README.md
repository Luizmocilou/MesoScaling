## Abstract

Understanding quantitative relationships between urban elements is crucial for a wide range of applications. Previous studies based on observations at the macroscopic level have suggested that the aggregated urban quantities (e.g., gross domestic product) scale systematically with population size across cities. However, at the mesoscopic level within cities, it is not well understood whether the relationships between urban elements obey similar patterns. Here, by analyzing four large-scale datasets covering hundreds of millions of mobile phone users and urban facilities, we investigate the mesoscopic scaling phenomena within cities. We find that the mesoscopic infrastructure volume and socioeconomic activity have robust sub- and super-linear power-law relationships with the active population; however, for a same scaling phenomenon, the power-law exponents vary in cities of similar population sizes. To explain these empirical observations, we propose a modeling framework by considering the heterogeneous distributions of population and facilities, and the spatial interactions between them. Analytical and numerical results suggest that, despite the large number of complexities that influence urban activities, the simple interaction rules can effectively explain the observed regularity and heterogeneity in scaling behaviors within cities.
